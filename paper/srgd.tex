% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{multirow}
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
We introduce Stochastic Repeated Gradient Descent(SRGD), a modification to
Stochastic Gradient Descent that takes advantage of CPU cache to improve compute
time and allow the use of large mini-batches, resulting in dramatically faster
time to convergence versus mini-batch SGD. 

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has long been the standard optimization method
in machine learning. Recent developments such as Adam and AdaGrad solve some of
the shortcomings of SGD by using adaptive learning rates and scaled gradients.
While these methods have seen substantial success, they can suffer from increased
storage requirements, which is problematic for large problems. Additionally,
they can be more challenging to implement, as the algorithms are more complex
than standard SGD. Stochastic Repeated Gradient Descent achieves dramatic gains
in compute time by taking advantage of CPU cache and allowing the use of larger
mini-batch sizes without degrading convergence results. Further, for the
mini-batch case of a single data point, SRGD reduces to standard SRGD, with a
marginally slower compute time. If SRGD is given an adaptive learning rate, such
as that proposed by Xu et. al. \cite{bib:xu-assgd}, performance is consistently better
across the board.

\subsection{Background}
Formally, we are solving the problem

\begin{equation}\label{eq:update}
    \theta = \arg \min_{\theta} \sum_{i=1}^n ||f(x_i; \theta) - y_i||_2^2
\end{equation}

where we have $n$ number of data points, $x_i \in x \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ and
corresponding labels $y_i \in \mathbb{R}$, and $f: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow
\mathbb{R}$. We assume $f(x;\theta)$ is a linear function, parameterized by
$\theta$ and given by~\ref{eq:f}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:f}
    f(x; \theta) = \sum_{i = 1}^d \theta_i x_i
\end{equation}


\subsubsection{Stochastic Gradient Descent}
Stochastic Gradient Descent is a derivative of Gradient Descent where the
gradient $\nabla f(x; \theta)$ is replaced by $\nabla f(x_i; \theta)$, an
approximation of the gradient calculated by computing the gradient at a randomly
selected point, $x_i \in x$, determined by uniformly sampling (with replacement) over the
data set. The parameter update is then performed via the standard
update~\ref{eq:sgd}, where $x_i$ is a single data point

\begin{equation}\label{eq:sgd}
    \theta_{k+1} \gets \theta_k - \alpha \nabla f(x_i; \theta_k)
\end{equation}

Each pass over the dataset is considered an epoch, thus multiple passes over the
dataset may occur. This approach, however, has a couple of drawbackswith the
main drawback being an increase in variance of the approximate gradient. This
results in slowing the rate of convergence when compared to Gradient Descent. A
number of approaches attempt to reduce this variance [refs-here], but the
simplest and most common approach to reduce the variance is mini-batching.

\subsubsection{Mini-Batch SGD}
Mini-batch SGD randomly samples some pre-determined number of points (say $b$
points, and without loss of generality let $m = \frac{n}{b}$, such that $b$ is a
multiple of the number of points) from a uniform distribution of the data,
without replacement. This mini-batch is used to attain a better (more stable)
approximation of the approximate gradient, which is then used in the weight
update~\ref{eq:update}.

\subsection{Stochastic Repeated Gradient Descent}
SRGD improves upon mini-batch SGD by using recently cached data to perform
several updates of the weights via~\ref{eq:update} before sampling new data. By
not sampling new data at each update, the mini-batch data remains in cache.
While this increases the variance in the theoretical convergence of our method,
the compute time is reduced. Additionally, we use a dynamic learning
rate, which is geometrically decreased by a factor of $\frac{1}{2}$ when successive
weight updates are within some threshold value $\epsilon$ of eachother. This
threshold is also reduced by a factor of $\frac{1}{2}$. We combine this with an
early stopping threshold, which compares the slope of the line connecting
successive weight updates to some threshold value $\epsilon_{stop}$.

We denote the gradient update term by $\Delta\theta_{i,j}^{k}(x_{I_i}, \alpha)$ as
simplification in notation. It is defined as:

\begin{equation*}
    \Delta\theta_{i,j}^{k}(x_{I_i}, \alpha) = -\alpha \nabla f(x_{I_i}; \theta_{i,j}^k)
\end{equation*}

The term $I_i$ is a set of indices defined

\begin{equation*}
    I_i = \{i | i \sim U[1,n]\}
\end{equation*}

where $n$, as noted previously, is the number of data points and the indices $i$
are IID random variable sampled from a uniform distribution on the interval
$[1,n]$. We use $I_i$ as an index to denote the set of $x_i$ whose indices are
in $I_i$.

\begin{equation*}
    x_{I_i} = \{ x_i | i \in I_i, \hspace{.5em}x_i \in x \}
\end{equation*}

\section{Algorithm}
Algorithm~\ref{fig:algorithm1}  details the SRGD algorithm. Additionally, we check for convergence
and stop early if convergence as been achieved. The key step is repeating with
weight update $r$ times using the same mini-batch data. This results in $r$
approximate gradient computations along with $r$ weight updates. After the
weights are updated, we check to see how close they are to the prior weights and
if they are close enough (i.e., convergence is slowing down), we decrease the
learning rate. This approach allows us to start out with a coarser learning rate
while avoiding over-shooting the minimum. By default, SRGD doubles the input
learning rate to make it even coarser. In the dynamic version, of
course this is offset by adaptively updating the learning rate based on
rate of convergence (measured by the distance between prior weight updates).

\section{Theory}

\section{Experiment}
Experiments were performed on a 3.4GHz Intel i7-6700K hexa-core workstation with 64GB
of RAM. In addition to measuring the time to convergence, we also measure the
number of steps taken to converge to the solution (where a step is considered a
weight update).

\subsection{Problem Definition}
The labeled data is generated via the function shown in
equation~\ref{eq:generator},

\begin{equation}\label{eq:generator}
    y(x;\omega) = \sum_{i=1}^d \omega_i x_i
\end{equation}

where $\omega \in [-10, 10]$ and $x \in [-10, 10]$. While this is a small problem,
it is easy to control and measure approximation error (since we know the
coefficients exactly). The coefficients, $\omega$, are sampled from the
distribution $U(-10, 10)$ while the $x$ values are generated by sample $x_i$ (the
i-th component of a given $x$) from the distribution $U(-10,10)$.

\subsection{Methodology}
We look at several metrics in assessing the validity and performance of SRGD. The
first metric is run time. This is simply the time it takes for comparably tuned
algorithms to converge to the solution. Our experiments consider four
algorithms: SGD, ASSGD, SRGD, ASSRGD. The ASSGD algorithm proposed by Xu et
al. \cite{bib:xu-assgd}, is the adaptive learning rate algorithm mentioned in the
preceding section. The SRGD runs do not use the adpative learning rate while
the ASSRGD runs do use an adaptive learning rate.

At the time of writing, a 1,000 dimensional case was running. The results that
follow are based on runs of dimension 10, 50, and 100. The number of data points
generated for each scenario was a function of the dimension, namely $dimension * 1000$.
Additionally, the threshold level used for the ASSG methods (ASSG and ASSSRGD) was
set to 0.001. It should be noted that this was probably not the optimal level and
further tuning is recommended.

\subsection{Results}
Based on our experiments there appear to be two domains in which SRGD is
optimal. In one domain, typically as the mini-batch size approaches the
problem size, SRGD takes more compute time but achieves materially better
accuracy. In the other domain, SRGD runs at a fraction of the time of
SGD and achieves better accuracy (frequently an order of magnitude better).

The implementation of SRGD used in this work multiplies the given learning
rate by a factor of two, which is why it run slightly faster than standard SGD
for the $r = 1$ case (since one would expect them to run at the same speed).
Given difference in times between SGD and SRGD for the $r = 1$ case in tables
presented here, it appears some additional tuning of the learning rate may
improve the convergence of SGD and SRGD for this problem.

Additionally (Need to add figure/table), it is interesting to note that the
SRGD and ASSRGD methods achieved better accuracy, typically in less time, and
they utilized fewer data points than standard SGD. In other words, they were
able to do more with less information.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.

% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.


\section{Future Work}
There are two key next steps in assessing this mehtod. The first
is to increase the compute time of the gradient. The reasoning behind
this approach is to perform a cost-benefit analysis of cache and
additional information versus additional compute time. In other words,
there is likely a tipping point where the additional information gained
by the repeated weight updates is offset by the time required to compute
the gradient. Whereas standard SGD extracts less information from
each data point per weight update than SRGD in a shorter period of time,
SRGD extracts more information but requires more time to do this. For the
results seen in this paper, that time tradeoff is offset by the additional
information and the help of CPU cache for data access. However, one would
expect there is a point where the additional time ultimately increases
the total compute time of SRGD such that SGD is actually faster.
